# Project created to study Spring AI solutions

Firstly you must set as a **OS Environment Variable** the following `OPEN_AI_TEST_SPRING_KEY` matching your **Open AI API Secret Key**

For now the only endpoint working is the **`localhost:8080/v1/chat/openai`** and you must consider the Spring Security secret key _auto generated each time you boot the application_ that appears in the **console**, so you can log in using it and the **user** as `user`
